 * HOW TO USE:
	export LD_PRELOAD=$DYNAMIC_LIB_PATH/trace.so
	export LD_PRELOAD=$DYNAMIC_LIB_PATH/bb_freq.so
	export LD_PRELOAD=$DYNAMIC_LIB_PATH/OOprofile.so

 * FEATURE:
	entre.so
    	entre is not a tool, it is a platform. all tools like trace
    	are developmented on it.
	trace.so:
    	trace is uesed to achieve all memory access trace.
	bb_freq.so:
    	bb_freq is used to achieve the frequency of any basic block,
    	you can used this infomation to obtain the the frequency of
    	any instruction.
	OOprofile.so:
    	OOprofile is used to achieve the function detail infomation
    	together with Oprofile under root. right now, it dose not
    	work very well, only proved that entre can work together with
    	Oprofile, because it consumes so much time when it works.
